# Transparent AI-Human Research Collaboration

A living methodology for ethical AI integration in doctoral research.

## About This Project

This project documents a comprehensive AI collaboration methodology developed during active dissertation research at Northeastern University (Spring 2025 - present). It provides frameworks, protocols, and transparent documentation for maintaining academic integrity while using AI assistance in scholarly work.

**Key Components:**
- Academic integrity framework with bright line tests
- Complete collaboration log (9+ documented sessions)
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Downloadable templates and protocols
- Real examples from actual research work

---

## Philosophy

This methodology is grounded in three core principles:

1. **Preserving Institutional Knowledge** - AI enhances but doesn't replace human expertise
2. **Creating Cognitive Space** - Efficiency at task level enables strategic thinking
3. **Shifting the Narrative** - From fear and restriction to education and responsible use

The same framework that works for human facilitation applies to AI collaboration: provide structure, maintain agency, enable independence rather than dependence.

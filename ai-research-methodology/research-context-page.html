                    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">My path to completing doctoral work is not linear. After exiting the EdD program in Spring 2022, I explored data science (2023) while leading professional development initiatives. Each attempt taught me something essential about what I was ready to study and how I needed to approach doctoral research.</p>
                    
                    <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">Non-linear paths aren't failures—they're iterative refinement of focus. Each experience contributed foundational knowledge that converged into the current work.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why I Left:</strong></p>
                    <p>I had a general idea of what I wanted to study (something about advising, support, higher education) but lacked the focused research question needed to progress successfully. The program requires clarity I didn't yet have.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
                    <p>Doctoral work requires more than interest—it needs a specific problem of practice, clear theoretical positioning, and methodological approach. I needed more professional experience to identify what truly mattered to study.</p>
                    
                    <p>This "exit" wasn't failure—it was data. I needed to return to practice to find my research question.</p>

                    <p>Curiosity about computational thinking and data approaches. Working at Network Science Institute exposed me to quantitative research; wanted formal training to understand it better.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What I Gained:</strong></p>
                    <p>Foundational knowledge of computer science and data science concepts. Logic course and CS fundamentals provided systematic way of thinking about technology—as tools requiring protocols and structured approaches, not mysterious magic.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why I Left:</strong></p>

                <div class="card">
                    <p>Between 2022-2024, while navigating graduate program decisions, I led two major professional development initiatives that shaped my facilitation philosophy and later informed my AI collaboration approach.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ACES Academic Advising Initiative (Summer 2022 - 2024)</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>What It Was:</strong></p>
                    <p>Community of practice bringing together academic advisors across Northeastern to address common pain points.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My Role:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sought feedback from advising leaders</li>
                        <li>Presented concept to potential participants</li>
                        <li>Facilitated regular meetings and discussions</li>
                        <li>Supported participants as they drove artifact creation through their collaboration and interaction</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Facilitation Approach:</strong></p>
                    <p>I saw my role as someone to prompt and occasionally prod participants, but allow sessions to evolve organically. When people felt they had space and permission to address what really mattered to them, they found ways to get to the root of their challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>This made it easier to provide targeted recommendations and resources in follow-ups rather than generic advice that didn't fit their contexts.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Create the conditions for growth; don't direct the growth. Provide structure without dictating outcomes.</p>
                    
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">The Partnership Facilitation (2022-2024)</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>Organization:</strong> <a href="https://thepartnership.com" target="_blank">The Partnership</a></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong></p>
                    <p>Leadership development program for early- and mid-career professionals, with institutional partnerships including Northeastern University.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My Background:</strong></p>
                    <p>Former participant who benefited from internal support from university leaders (particularly DEI department) and The Partnership staff. Wanted to give back.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My Role:</strong></p>
                    <p>Facilitated check-in groups with Northeastern participants across multiple cohorts. Held space for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sharing successes</li>
                        <li>Discussing challenges</li>
                        <li>Exchanging information and resources</li>
                        <li>Brainstorming translation to their Northeastern contexts</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Facilitation Approach:</strong></p>
                    <p>Same principle as ACES—prompt, prod, hold space, but let the sessions evolve based on what participants actually needed. Trust that given space and structure, people will surface what matters most.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Support doesn't mean directing. The best facilitation creates containers for growth while maintaining participant agency over their own development.</p>
                    
                    <div class="callout" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                        <p><strong>Connecting principle:</strong> I was trying to model the kind of engagement that I hoped we could develop at scale at Northeastern—and later realized these same principles applied to AI collaboration: provide structure, maintain agency, enable independence.</p>

                <h2>Career Progression: Learning from Research Excellence</h2>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <p>Working at two distinct research institutes shaped how I think about research problems, interdisciplinarity, and the relationship between rigorous inquiry and practical application.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Network Science Institute (NSI) - PhD Program Manager</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>What I Learned from Students:</strong></p>
                    <p>PhD students at NSI were tackling genuinely messy, important problems—misinformation, polarization, complex systems dynamics. Watching them navigate uncertainty while maintaining analytical rigor showed me what doctoral research actually looks like.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What I Learned from Faculty:</strong></p>
                    <p>NSI faculty demonstrated how to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Approach complex problems systematically</li>
                        <li>Communicate technical work to multiple audiences</li>
                        <li>Find pathways to meaningful impact</li>
                        <li>Balance theoretical rigor with practical relevance</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The fact that these researchers wanted to work with and understand messy, important problems—and find successful ways of communicating both the issue and potential pathways to a variety of audiences—spoke to me.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Impact on My Work:</strong></p>
                    <p>This exposure crystallized that I wanted to return to doctoral work. But not for theoretical abstraction—for addressing real problems in higher education contexts.</p>
                    
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">College of Arts, Media and Design (CAMD) - Associate Director of PhD Programs (Current)</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>What I See in Students:</strong></p>
                    <p>CAMD PhD students pursue creative, practical approaches to their research topics. Both PhD programs emphasize:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interdisciplinary research</li>
                        <li>Rigorous academic inquiry</li>
                        <li>Communication to various audiences</li>
                        <li>Practical applications of research</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This combination—rigor + creativity + practical application—represents the kind of scholarship I value.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Working with Students Daily:</strong></p>
                    <p>Supporting PhD students through their research journey gives me daily insight into:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What actually helps doctoral students succeed</li>
                        <li>Where support structures fail</li>
                        <li>How supervisory relationships function</li>

                    <h3>How My Professional Experience Connects to This Research</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>From facilitation work:</strong> Understanding of scaffolded support. I learned what helps people develop vs. what constrains them. Same principles apply to supervisory relationships.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>From NSI/CAMD work:</strong> Daily observation of doctoral dynamics. I see firsthand how support structures enable or limit student development. My research studies exactly what I support professionally.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>From multiple degree attempts:</strong> Understanding non-linear paths. My own educational journey wasn't straightforward. This gives me insight into how students navigate uncertainty and setbacks.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>From data science exploration:</strong> Systems thinking. I approach research systematically, with clear protocols and verification. This computational thinking informed both my research approach and AI collaboration methodology.</p>
